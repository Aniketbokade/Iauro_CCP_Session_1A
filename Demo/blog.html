          All modern websites and web applications are built using three
          <em>fundamental</em>
          technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the languages of the
          web.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all
          about, and why you too should learn it.
        </p>
        <div id="html_section">
          <h2>Introduction to HTML</h2>
        <h4>What is HTML?</h4>
        <p>
          HTML stands for <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext
          <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage. It's a markup
          language that web developers use to structure and describe the content
          of a webpage (not a programming language).
        </p>
        <p>
          HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content:
          paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers
          understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.
        </p>
        <p>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>The opening tag</li>
          <li>The closing tag</li>
          <li>The actual element</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You can learn more at the MDN Web Docs.</p>

        <h4>Why should you learn HTML?</h4>
        <p>
          There are countless reasons for learning the fundamental language of
          the web. Here are 5 of them:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>To be able to use the fundamental web dev language</li>
          <li>
            To hand-craft beautiful websites instead of relying on tools like
            Worpress or Wix
          </li>
          <li>To build web applications</li>
          <li>To impress friends</li>
          <li>To have fun ðŸ˜ƒ</li>
        </ul>
        </div>


        <div id="css_section">
          <h2>Introduction to CSS</h2>
          <h4>What is CSS?</h4>
          <p>
            CSS stands for <strong>C</strong>ascading  <strong>S</strong>tyle  <strong>S</strong>heets.
            It is a style sheet language
            which is used to describe the look and formatting of a document written
             in markup language. It provides an additional feature to HTML.

          </p>
          <p>
            CSS is used along with HTML and JavaScript in most websites to create user
            interfaces for web applications and user interfaces for many mobile applications.
          </p>
          <p> It is
          generally used with HTML to change the style of web pages and user
          interfaces. It can also be used with any kind of XML documents including
          plain XML, SVG and XUL.</p>

          <h4>Benefits of CSS</h4>
          <p>
            There are countless reasons for learning the fundamental language of
            the web. Here are some of them:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Solves a big problem</li>
            <li>Saves a lot of time</li>
            <li>Provide more attributes</li>
            <li>To have fun ðŸ˜ƒ</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div id="js_section">
          <h2>Introduction to JS</h2>
          <h4>What is JS?</h4>
          <p>
            JS stands for <strong>J</strong>ava<strong>S</strong>cript.
            JavaScript (js) is a light-weight object-oriented programming language
            which is used by several websites for scripting the webpages.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is an interpreted, full-fledged programming language that enables dynamic
            interactivity on websites when applied to an HTML document.
          </p>
          <p> It was
          introduced in the year 1995 for adding programs to the webpages in
          the Netscape Navigator browser. Since then, it has been adopted by
          all other graphical web browsers.</p>

          <p>With JavaScript, users can build
          modern web applications to interact directly without reloading the
          page every time. The traditional website uses js to provide several
          forms of interactivity and simplicity.</p>

          <h4>Features of JS</h4>
          <p>
            There are countless reasons for learning the fundamental language of
            the web. Here are some of them:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>It is a light-weighted and interpreted language.</li>
            <li>It is a case-sensitive language.</li>
            <li>JavaScript is supportable in several operating systems including, Windows, macOS, etc</li>
            <li>It provides good control to the users over the web browsers.</li>
